#### Sector Analysis
1. Identify and analyze which sectors have higher Scope 1 and 2 emissions and which have lower
emissions.
2. Explain the reasons behind the differences in emission levels across sectors.

#### Data Requirements for Model Improvement
1. Identify additional data that could improve the accuracy and reliability of the emission
estimation models.
2. Explain how the additional data would enhance the models and lead to better results.
